# JavaScript Playground

A JavaScript playground for the Teleporter team. This is where we have a chance to play around with new ideas, frameworks and techniques and share our learning.

Each directory contains it's own README file and many have test suites that can be run.

# Examples

- **numtools**: Rails-style number helpers (e.g. `3.times { |i| # do something }`).
